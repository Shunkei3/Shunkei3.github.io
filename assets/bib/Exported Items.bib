	abstract = {Estimating site-specific crop yield response to changes to input (e.g., seed, fertilizer) management is a critical step in making economically optimal site-specific input management recommendations. Past studies have attempted to estimate yield response functions using various Machine Learning (ML) methods, including the Random Forest (RF), Boosted Random Forest (BRF), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods. This study proposes use of the Causal Forest (CF) model, which is one of the emerging ML methods that comprise “Causal Machine Learning.” Unlike previous yield-prediction-oriented ML methods, CF focuses strictly on esti­ mating heterogeneous treatment effects (changes in yields that result from changes in input application rates) of inputs. We report results of using Monte Carlo simulations assuming various production scenarios to test the effectiveness of CF in estimating site-specific economically optimal nitrogen rates (EONRs), comparing CF with the yield-prediction-oriented ML methods RF, BRF, and CNN. CF’s estimations of site-specific EONRs were su­ perior under all scenarios considered. We also show that the model’s yield prediction accuracy need not imply EONR prediction accuracy.},

	title = {Aquifer depletion exacerbates agricultural drought losses in the {US} {High} {Plains}},
	abstract = {Aquifer depletion poses a major threat to the ability of farmers, food supply chains, and rural economies globally to use groundwater as a means of adapting to climate variability and change. Empirical research has demonstrated the large differences in drought risk exposure that exist between rainfed and irrigated croplands, but previous work commonly assumes water supply for the latter is unconstrained. In this paper, we evaluate how aquifer depletion affects the resilience of irrigated crop production to drought risk using over 30 years of data on historical corn and soybean yields, production areas, and aquifer conditions for the High Plains region in the United States. We show that aquifer depletion reduces the ability of farmers to sustain irrigated crop yields and production areas in drought years. Our findings demonstrate that drought-related production losses on irrigated croplands increase non-linearly with aquifer depletion, highlighting the need for proactive aquifer conservation interventions to support adaptation and resilience to future increases in rainfall variability under climate change.},
