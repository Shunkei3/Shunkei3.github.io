    "text": "Current Research Projects\nKakimoto, S. “Heterogeneous Effects of the Adoption of Modern Irrigation Technology - Empirical Evidence and Economic Theory”\n\nI am interested in agricultural irrigation and the behavioral mechanisms underlying farmers’ decisions to adopt water-saving technologies or conservation practices. While advanced irrigation technologies have the potential to reduce water consumption without compromising agricultural productivity or farmer welfare, their adoption can sometimes lead to unintended consequences — including increased total water use and accelerated resource depletion. This project builds on a theoretical framework to empirically examine the heterogeneous effects of modern irrigation technology adoption on farmers’ water use and productivity. It also explores the behavioral mechanisms that drive these outcomes.\n\nGallagher, N. and Kakimoto, S. “Yield Response to Nitrogen in Agricultural Production Models”\n\nThis project proposes a new modeling framework for agricultural production in Minnesota. The innovation lies in incorporating nitrogen yield response directly into the land allocation model. This approach enables more realistic adjustments in both nitrogen application rates and land use decisions in response to changes in nitrogen fertilizer prices and crop prices — a critical feature for evaluating alternative policy strategies aimed at reducing nitrogen pollution in the state.\n\nKakimoto, S. and Mieno, T. “Size and the Nature of Measurement Error in Gridded Weather Datasets and its Consequential Estimation Bias in Regression Model: an Application to PRISM Datasets for the US Midwest Regions”\n\nGridded weather datasets, such as PRISM, have been widely used in econometric analysis to study the impact of weather on economic outcomes. Yet, concerns persist regarding the measurement errors in these datasets and their consequential estimation bias. This study systematically quantifies and characterizes the measurement errors in growing-season total precipitation and extreme degree days (EDD) derived from PRISM. Using exact spatial matches between PRISM grid cells and ground weather stations, we find that PRISM weather variables exhibit nontrivial measurement errors that are negatively correlated with true weather outcomes, especially for EDD. Moreover, the variance of these errors increases with the extremity of actual weather outcomes. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the resulting estimation bias in weather impact on farm-level corn yields. The simulation results show that the average bias is moderate when estimating weather impacts on corn yield across the entire Corn Belt region due to large weather variations. However, the bias becomes more substantial at smaller spatial scales, such as individual states, where limited variation amplifies the relative influence of measurement error. We conclude that researchers should exercise caution when using PRISM data in econometric models, especially in subregional analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n Publications\nMieno, T., T. Foster, S.

    "text": "I have served as a teaching assistant for various courses in Applied Economics. My main duties included leading weekly discussion sessions, creating and grading assignments, and holding office hours.\nI lead my discussion sessions with a single motto: knowing is different from understanding. Although this sounds obvious, I think it is a critical insight for learning something. I tend to feel I understand the material after I go to lectures. However, once I face complicated questions in the problem set, I often find myself unable to figure out where to start thinking and how to apply the knowledge to approach the problems. This is a typical situation where I know the concepts but do not understand them. Whenever I encounter this situation, I fill in the argument that I missed to bridge my knowledge to the concepts I want to understand by reading related research articles or textbooks. From this, I learned that knowing a mathematical formula or concept as written is not the whole point of learning. Rather, understanding the concept together with its background, such as why it matters, for what kind of problem the concept is useful, and how it connects to other concepts, is important.\nIn this light, in my discussion sessions, I remind students, “Do you really understand the material?” by asking basic questions and attempting to walk through in-depth arguments to aid them in applying the concepts. For example, in an econometric analysis class, although the definition of the sampling distribution is not difficult, when it comes to the question of why it is important to understand the sampling distribution, most of the students get stuck. To help them understand this point, I worked through a simple exercise with students to explain it step-by-step. Once students understand the foundation of the concepts, they will be able to correctly apply them to solve problem sets, which in turn leads to higher confidence and motivation to learn more. With the same spirit, whenever I give feedback to students on their assignments, I attempt to clarify why they got the wrong conclusion by suggesting the points that students missed or misunderstood.\nAlthough I value the fundamental understanding of the concepts in my discussion sessions, I also try to avoid having students focus too much on the details and lose sight of the broader picture. Students are often required to cover many topics in a short period. Thus, they tend to be lost in what they are doing and how it is connected to the topics they learned previously. To address this, I periodically step back to highlight the overall structure of the material so that students understand where they are and how the topics fit together.\nI believe this approach has helped students engage more meaningfully with the material — a contribution that has been recognized by the following teaching awards and nominations:\n\nCFANS Graduate Assistant Teaching Award (2025) - College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences, University of Minnesota\nNominated for AAEA TLC Graduate Student Teaching Award (2024) – by Professor Frances Homans\nTeaching Assistant Award for 5000/8000 Level Classes (2023-2024) - Department of Applied Economics, University of Minnesota"
