    "text": "Target Audience\nThis post is aimed at researchers who run real computational workloads but do not have formal training in system administration or software engineering. Especially, if you own multiple computers, such as a powerful desktop workstation and a lightweight laptop, and have wondered about the following questions, this post might be useful for you:\n\n“Can I utilize the CPU, memory, and storage of my desktop computer in my home while working remotely on my laptop—for example, from my university office or a library?”\n“Can I work with datasets stored on my desktop computer without downloading or copying them to my laptop? I also don’t like to carry around large external hard drives.”\n“Can I monitor progress and diagnose errors in long-running jobs without sitting in front of my desktop machine?”\n“Is there a way to avoid constantly worrying about the storage and performance limits of my laptop?”\n\nThese challenges are unlikely to be unique to me. As working with large datasets and computationally intensive tasks has become a standard part of academic research, many researchers face similar constraints in their day-to-day workflows.\nThe solution I eventually settled on is based on SSH (Secure Shell). It is not a new idea in computing circles, but it seems like it is under-documented, under-taught, and under-utilized in the research community. When I first saw the term “SSH”, it sounded like a tool for software developers and system administrators, but not for academic researchers. However, after exploring its capabilities, I realized that SSH can be a powerful tool for researchers who work on intensive computational tasks and large datasets as well. Also I believe that the opportunity cost of the time required to learn and set up SSH is small relative to the potential benefits it can bring to your workflow.\nBeing able to seamlessly access and utilize resources of a more powerful machine can be beneficial. My hope is to be helpful to those who might be facing similar challenges in their workflow by sharing my experience."

    "text": "Background of My Situation\nI use two machines for my research work. One is a relatively powerful desktop computer, a Mac Studio, that I mainly use at home. It is the most powerful (and expensive) machine I have ever owned. The other is a lightweight laptop, a ThinkPad running Linux (Debian13), which I use when working from my university office, the library, or elsewhere.\nWhenever I worked on my laptop, the same questions kept coming back to me: how could I best utilize the power of my desktop computer while I was away from home? My laptop has limited storage and computing capacity, while my desktop has abundant resources that often sat idle simply because I was not physically in front of it.\nAfter some research and trial-and-error, I found a solution that works well for me: using the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol together with the VS Code Remote SSH extension1. Once I establish an SSH connection between my laptop and desktop computer, I can access the desktop computer remotely. This allows me to run commands, execute programs, and manage files on the desktop machine from my laptop, as if I were physically sitting in front of it. For typical coding, data analysis, and job monitoring, I have found the remote setup to feel effectively indistinguishable from working locally2.\nIn the next section, I outline the steps I took to set up this workflow. I will not go into exhaustive technical details, but rather describe how I set up SSH and VS Code Remote SSH in practice. But before that, let me walk through the basic idea behind this workflow."

    "text": "Mental Model\n\nBasic idea & How SSH fits in\nIn my setup, the desktop computer acts as the machine where all computation and data live, while the laptop serves primarily as an interface for accessing and controlling that machine. Rather than copying files back and forth or trying to keep multiple machines in sync, I treat the desktop computer as the single place where my research environment exists.\nIn more technical terms, the desktop computer functions as a server that is always available on my home network, while the laptop acts as a client that connects to it on demand. When the two are connected, the laptop sends commands to the desktop computer, all computation happens on the desktop machine, and the results are sent back to the laptop for display.3\nBecause this communication happens over a network, it needs to be secure and private. This is where SSH comes in. SSH provides a secure way for the laptop to connect to the desktop computer and communicate with it without exposing the connection to others on the network.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy VS Code Remote SSH matters\nWhile SSH alone is sufficient for running commands and managing files, when you are coding through VS Code, VS Code Remote SSH extension is what makes this setup truly practical for coding and data analysis. It allows the VS Code interface on my laptop to connect to a full development environment running on the remote desktop computer. Extensions that are relevant to coding and execution run on the remote machine, while the editor interface remains local. Instead of merely accessing files, I can open remote project directories directly in VS Code, edit code, run scripts, use the integrated terminal, and take advantage of language features such as autocomplete and debugging—all operating in the remote environment where the data and computation reside. From the user’s perspective, the editor behaves just like local VS Code, even though all IDE functionality runs on the desktop machine.\nFor more details about the VS Code Remote SSH extension, please refer to the official documentation: Remote Development using SSH - Visual Studio Code."

    "section": "Setting up VS Code Remote SSH",
    "text": "Setting up VS Code Remote SSH\nWith this mental model in mind, the actual setup is relatively straightforward. In the remainder of this section, I walk through the steps I took to configure SSH access on my desktop and laptop computers and how to connect them, and then set up VS Code Remote SSH.\n\nStep 1: Preparing the Desktop Computer (The Server)\n\nStep 1.1 Enabling SSH Access\nIf you are using a Mac (like me) and want to make it as a server that can be accessed via SSH, you need to enable Remote Login in the System Preferences.\n\nSystem Settings &gt; General &gt; Sharing\nTurn on “Remote Login”\nClick  next to “Remote Login”\nUnder “Allow access for”, select “Only these users” and add your user account.\n\nThis starts the SSH server on your Mac.\n\n\nStep 1.2 Preventing Sleep Mode\nHere are the steps:\n\nSystem Settings &gt; Energy\nIn the Energy settings:\n2.1 Turn on “Prevent automatic sleeping when the display is off” and “Wake for network access” options. 2.3 Turn off the “Put hard disks to sleep when possible” option.\n\n\n\nStep 1.3 Finding Username & Hostname\nOpen Terminal on your Mac, and run\nwhoami # to get your username\nhostname # to get your hostname (i.e., server name)\n&lt;username@hostname&gt; will be your SSH address to connect to this Mac from your laptop.　For example, if whoami returns jo, and hostname returns jos-Mac-Studio.local, then your SSH address\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Setting up the Laptop (The Client)\nI assume that you have already installed VS Code on your laptop.\n\nStep 2.1 Generate an SSH Key\nOpen Terminal on your laptop, and run the following command\nssh-keygen -t ed25519\nPress Enter to accept the default file location. What this does is to generate a pair of cryptographic keys (public and private keys) using the ed25519 algorithm for SSH authentication in your ~/.ssh directory on your laptop.\n\n\nStep 2.2 Copy the Public Key to the Server\nNext, copy the public key to the server (in my case, the Mac Studio). A copy of the public key of your laptop needs to be transferred to the server using the SSH address you found in Step 1.3.\nRun the following command in your laptop terminal:\nssh-copy-id &lt;username@hostname&gt;\nPlease replace &lt;username@hostname&gt; with your actual SSH address of the server.\n\n\nStep 2.3 Test SSH Connection\nNow, test the plain SSH connection on your laptop terminal:\nssh &lt;username@hostname&gt;\nIf you successfully connect to the server, you should see a terminal prompt of the remote machine. You can type exit to disconnect from the server and return to your laptop terminal.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Setting up VS Code Remote SSH on Your Laptop\n\nStep 3.1 Install the Remote - SSH Extension\nOn your laptop, open VS Code, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X), and search for “Remote – SSH” extension by Microsoft. Install it.\n\n\nStep 3.2 Add a New SSH Host\nOpen your laptop VS Code, and follow these steps:\n\nOpen the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P), and type “Remote-SSH: Add New SSH Host …”. Select it.\nIn the input box, enter the SSH address of your server that you found in Step 1.3, e.g., &lt;username@hostname&gt;. Press Enter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3.3 Connect to the SSH Host\n\nIn VS Code, open the Command Palette again.\nType “Remote-SSH: Connect to Host” and select the host you just added (e.g., &lt;username@hostname&gt;).\nA new VS Code window will open, connected to the remote server. You can now open folders, edit files, and run commands on the remote machine directly from this window.\n\nOr, you can also click the &gt;&lt; icon in the bottom-left corner of VS Code window, and select the SSH host from the list.\n\n\nStep 3.4 Quick Check:\n\nOpen the integrated terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+or Cmd+).\nType pwd and press Enter. You should see the home directory of the remote server.\n\nIf you see that, congratulations! You have successfully set up VS Code Remote SSH\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Setup Tailscale for Secure Remote Access Across Networks\nAlthough the setup above works well when both your desktop computer (server) and laptop (client) are on the same local network (e.g., at home), it typically does not work once they are on different networks (e.g., when your laptop is on university or public Wi-Fi). In such cases, the desktop computer is usually behind a home router and firewall, and direct SSH access from outside the local network is blocked unless you configure port forwarding, which can be complex and potentially insecure.\nTo connect securely across networks, you can use Tailscale. Tailscale is free, and it creates a secure, encrypted private network between your devices, making them behave as if they were on the same LAN. This allows you to use SSH (and use VS Code Remote-SSH) reliably from anywhere.\nPlease see this website for more details: Tailscale quickstart.\n\nStep 4.1 Create a Tailscale Account\nCreate a Tailscale account at Tailscale. You’ll manage devices later from the Tailscale admin console.\n\n\nStep 4.2 Set up Tailscale on the Server\nOn the server (your desktop computer), follow these steps:\n\nDownload and install Tailscale on the server machine (Follow the instructions on Tailscale website).\nOpen the Tailscale app and log in with your Tailscale account.\nOn the Tailscale app, go to “Settings”, and click “Show me how” under CLI integration. Then, allow to add tailscale command to your PATH.\nOpen Terminal, and run tailscale status to verify that Tailscale is running.\n\n\n\nStep 4.3 Set up Tailscale on the Client\nOn the client (your laptop), follow similar steps. I am using Linux on my laptop, so I followed the instructions for Linux on Tailscale website. I simply ran the codes illustrated there.\nOpen Tailscale admin console, and verify that both your server and client devices are listed there.\n\n\nStep 4.4 Turn on MagicDNS\nAs Tailscale recommends, I checked that Magic DNS is turned on. It makes it easier to connect to your devices using human-readable names instead of IP addresses. To do this, go to the Tailscale admin console &gt; DNS tab, and make sure that the “MagicDNS” option is enabled.\nAlso, I changed the device name of my server (desktop computer) to something easier to remember. I changed it to “server”.\n\n\nStep 4.5 Test SSH Connection over Tailscale\nNow, you can test SSH connection over Tailscale. Suppose that my username on the server is “shunkei”, and my server device name is “mac”, then I can connect to the server from my laptop terminal with the following command:\nssh shunkei@mac\n\n\nStep 4.6 Shortcut for Connecting to the Remote Server\nIt’s cumbersome to type ssh shunkei@mac command every time I want to connect to the remote server through Terminal. You can set your SSH config file to create a shortcut. Open your laptop terminal, and edit the ~/.ssh/config file (create it if it does not exist). You can open it with nano editor with nano ~/.ssh/config command (or code ~/.ssh/config if you want to use VS Code). Then, add the following lines:\nHost &lt;server-name&gt;\n  HostName &lt;HostName&gt;\n  User &lt;username&gt;\n  IdentitiesOnly yes\nYou need to replace &lt;server-name&gt;, &lt;HostName&gt;, and &lt;username&gt; with your actual values. &lt;server-name&gt; is a user-defined alias for the server, and what you will type after ssh command. &lt;HostName&gt; is the machine name you set in Tailscale (e.g., mac-studio in my case). &lt;username&gt; is your username on the server (the output of whoami command on the server machine).\nFor example, if ~/.ssh/config file contains the following lines:\nHost server\n  HostName mac\n  User shunkei\n  IdentitiesOnly yes\nThen you can simply run ssh server on Terminal to connect to the remote server.\nCongratulations! You have successfully set up SSH access to your remote server over Tailscale. You can now work on your remote server from anywhere, without being bothered by the limitations of your laptop."

    "text": "Current Research Projects\nKakimoto, S. “Heterogeneous Effects of the Adoption of Modern Irrigation Technology - Empirical Evidence and Economic Theory”\n\nI am interested in agricultural irrigation and the behavioral mechanisms underlying farmers’ decisions to adopt water-saving technologies or conservation practices. While advanced irrigation technologies have the potential to reduce water consumption without compromising agricultural productivity or farmer welfare, their adoption can sometimes lead to unintended consequences — including increased total water use and accelerated resource depletion. This project builds on a theoretical framework to empirically examine the heterogeneous effects of modern irrigation technology adoption on farmers’ water use and productivity. It also explores the behavioral mechanisms that drive these outcomes.\n\n\nGallagher, N. and Kakimoto, S. “Yield Response to Nitrogen in Agricultural Production Models”\n\nThis project proposes a new modeling framework for agricultural production in Minnesota. The innovation lies in incorporating nitrogen yield response directly into the land allocation model. This approach enables more realistic adjustments in both nitrogen application rates and land use decisions in response to changes in nitrogen fertilizer prices and crop prices — a critical feature for evaluating alternative policy strategies aimed at reducing nitrogen pollution in the state.\n\n\nKakimoto, S. and Mieno, T. “Size and the Nature of Measurement Error in Gridded Weather Datasets and its Consequential Estimation Bias in Regression Model: an Application to PRISM Datasets for the US Midwest Regions”\n\nGridded weather datasets, such as PRISM, have been widely used in econometric analysis to study the impact of weather on economic outcomes. Yet, concerns persist regarding the measurement errors in these datasets and their consequential estimation bias. This study systematically quantifies and characterizes the measurement errors in growing-season total precipitation and extreme degree days (EDD) derived from PRISM. Using exact spatial matches between PRISM grid cells and ground weather stations, we find that PRISM weather variables exhibit nontrivial measurement errors that are negatively correlated with true weather outcomes, especially for EDD. Moreover, the variance of these errors increases with the extremity of actual weather outcomes. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the resulting estimation bias in weather impact on farm-level corn yields. The simulation results show that the average bias is moderate when estimating weather impacts on corn yield across the entire Corn Belt region due to large weather variations. However, the bias becomes more substantial at smaller spatial scales, such as individual states, where limited variation amplifies the relative influence of measurement error. We conclude that researchers should exercise caution when using PRISM data in econometric models, especially in subregional analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n Publications\nMieno, T., T. Foster, S.

    "text": "When I first started learning R during my undergraduate econometrics coursework, I found it whimsical yet challenging to use, and I was not motivated to pursue it further. The major turning point in my R journey came when I started graduate school and began working as a research assistant under my advisor, Taro. Since then, my initial impression—that R code is cluttered and requires repetitive tasks—was completely overturned.\nOne lesson I learned from my early experience with R is that choosing the right learning resources is crucial for mastering the language effectively (and I believe this applies to learning any programming language). In my case, I was fortunate to learn R through  Taro’s courses and related research projects. I was exposed to a wide range of well-structured and clean R scripts, which significantly improve my learning experience.\nThe goal of this mini-course is to share my experience learning R, highlight useful resources that helped me along the way, and provide a structured path for beginners to get started with R programming. The original materials for this mini-course were developed for incoming PhD students in the Applied Economics program and the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota in Summer 2024. For each lecture, I created both lecture slides and hands-on exercises to help students practice the concepts covered.\nA unique feature of this mini-course is that all code examples can be run directly in your web browser1. This allows you to tweak the code and see the results immediately. This feature may be especially helpful for beginners who want to run code line by line and understand how each component works—without the hassle of copying and pasting code into a local R environment—or for those who simply want to modify parameters and observe how the output changes. I received positive feedback from students who took the course, many of whom noted that this functionality made it easier to follow the lectures and practice R programming.\nOf course, I recommend you to set up R and RStudio on your local machine and practice R programming there as well. To install R and Rstudio, you can follow  this instruction."

You can start a tmux session on the remote server, run your commands, and even if your ssh connection drops, your tmux session will continue running in the background. When you reconnect, you can simply reattach to your tmux session and pick up right where you left off. This is particularly beneficial for long-running tasks.\nLet me back up a bit and explain what tmux and Alacritty are, and why they are useful.\n…\n\n\n\n Back to top"
