# About Me
<!-- I am a PhD student in Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota. My research interests lie in the intersection of environmental and resource economics and agricultural production economics, with an emphasis on agricultural water resource management and related environmental and agricultural policy issues. I also study the adoption of conservation technologies. In this line of work, I am particularly interested in understanding how such adoption decisions influence producers' resource management decisions, and associated environmental and economic outcomes, with implications for the design and evaluation of policy interventions. My research builds on established theoretical and empirical frameworks in environmental and agricultural economics, using microeconomic theory and econometric methods to study producer behavior under resource constraints, policy interventions, and environmental uncertainty.  -->

I am a PhD student in Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota. My research lies at the intersection of environmental and resource economics and agricultural production economics, with a focus on agricultural water resource management and conservation technology adoption. I study how adoption choices and policy incentives shape producers' resource management behavior and associated environmental and economic outcomes. Building on established theoretical and empirical frameworks, I use microeconomic theory and econometric methods to analyze producer behavior under resource constraints, environmental uncertainty, and policy interventions.
