## R programming and Quarto

R (and Quarto) is my primary tools for my academic research. I use R for:

+ data wrangling, statistical analysis and visualization, and goespatial analysis. 
+ integrating Python script and functions within R script using the `reticulate` package for specific tasks
+ writing reproducible research documents such as academic papers, reports, and presentation slides in combination with Quarto and some VS code extensions (e.g., citation picker for Zotero).

**Here, I share my experience of learning R and some useful resources that helped me along the way.**
